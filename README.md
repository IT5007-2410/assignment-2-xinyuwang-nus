# Ticket to Ride

This is a basic React application that allows users to manage travellers for a ticketing system. The system lets users view all travellers, add new ones, delete existing travellers, and see available and occupied seats.

## Features

- **View Travellers**: Displays a list of all current travellers, including their ID, name, phone number, booking time, and assigned seat.
- **Add New Traveller**: Users can add a new traveller by providing their name, phone number, and seat number. 
- **Delete Traveller**: Users can delete a traveller by their ID, with feedback indicating if the deletion was successful or if the traveller was not found.
- **View Available and Occupied Seats**: Shows a visual representation of all available and occupied seats.
- **Feedback Messages**: Provides real-time feedback for operations like adding and deleting travellers, indicating success or failure.

## Project Structure

- **`initialTravellers`**: Holds the default list of travellers.
- **`Add` Component**: Contains the form for adding a new traveller, including validation for required fields and available seats.
- **`Delete` Component**: Contains the form for deleting a traveller by their ID.
- **`Display` Component**: Shows the list of all current travellers in a table format.
- **`Homepage` Component**: Displays the number of free seats and a visual grid showing occupied and free seats.
- **`TicketToRide` Component**: The main parent component that manages state and handles navigation between different views (Homepage, Add, Delete, Display).

## Components Overview

### 1. **Add Component**
Allows users to add a traveller to the system. The travellerâ€™s name, phone number, and seat number are required. Seat number is validated to ensure it's below the total number of available seats, and that all seats are not already occupied.

### 2. **Delete Component**
Allows users to delete a traveller by ID. Feedback is provided if the traveller is successfully deleted or if no traveller with the provided ID exists.

### 3. **Display Component**
Displays a table of all travellers, showing their ID, name, phone, booking time, and assigned seat.

### 4. **Homepage Component**
Visual representation of available and occupied seats, with a summary of total free seats.

## Validation Rules

- **Add Traveller**:
  - All fields (name, phone, and seat) are required.
  - The seat number must be less than or equal to the total available seats.
  - Cannot add a new traveller if all seats are occupied.

- **Delete Traveller**:
  - A traveller can only be deleted if they exist in the system.
  - Feedback is shown if the traveller does not exist.

## How to Run the Application

## Customization

- **Total Seats**: The total number of seats can be modified by changing the `initialTotalSeats` value in the `TicketToRide` component.
- **Initial Travellers**: The default set of travellers is stored in the `initialTravellers` array. You can customize it to reflect different initial data.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling the buttons, forms, and alerts.
- **JavaScript**: For writing the logic and managing component states.
